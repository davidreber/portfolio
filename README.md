# Portfolio for David Reber

I've collected here a few of my favorite projects. As this portfolio is newly-formed, please check back for updates. 

The portfolio includes some machine learning projects I've completed or am currently working on. In addition, I've also included some technical presentations I've given, to both technical and non-technical audiences, to give a sense of my ability to communicate conplex concepts concisely.

Please reach out if you have any questions or comments!
