# Portfolio for David Reber

I've collected here a few of my favorite projects.

The portfolio includes some machine learning projects I've completed or am currently working on. In addition, I've also included some technical presentations I've given, to both technical and non-technical audiences, to give a sense of my ability to communicate complex concepts concisely.
